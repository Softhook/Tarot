This Tarot deck was created by Christian Nold, Georgy Holden, James Warren as part of an Open University scholarship project. The card designs are based on the wishes, hopes and dreams submitted by Design students from the U101 module over the last decade. The students wrote their wishes onto postcards that they posted to us and we transcribed and analysed by hand and then transformed into graphics using generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and lots of human labour. The design was created with Adobe Firefly, Photoshop, p5.js, Chat GPT o1 and the typefaces Roman Holiday Sketch and Poppins.

Roman Holiday Sketch is a hand drawn font by artist Austin Owens published by Austie Bost Fonts.

The Poppins typeface is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1. Copyright 2020 The Poppins Project Authors (https://github.com/itfoundry/Poppins)
